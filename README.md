# Reely Skinny
*Lightweight Wordpress theme development*

## Overview
After building within the constraints of several varied themes and templates, I realized I was consistently adding certain functionalities and trimming fat. I opted to start my own theme project focusing on lightweight no-frills development. **Note: This theme does not have 'settings' or its own dashboard.** There is very little that can be customized in this theme outside of the file structure. I'm building this to expedite site building for web developers. It's not using the most advanced technologies or languages. I'm trying to keep it as simple as possible while keeping with web standards. The idea is that anyone could pick up what I build and easily work with it.

## Framework
 In keeping with web standards, I've implemented [Foundation 5] (http://foundation.zurb.com/) as the core framework. This keeps things easy and adds a little style to get you started.

Reely Skinny is build to be a parent theme in a Wordpress Multisite setup. Once the code gets a little tighter, I'll be minimizing the files for optimal performance. I'll try to remember to include both formats to make your life easier.

## Updates
Reely Skinny is a living project and I welcome any input or suggestion on streamlining process.  At present, the theme is untested beyond Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. I've not worked with many plugins, and can't confirm compatibility web-wide. If it works for you, great. If not, suck it up and either fix it, or move on. If you do find a break, fix it. If you find a fix, let me know.

#### Update 7/27/2015
As with most ongoing product development cycles, we go dark from time to time. Learn new things. Make unposted updates, and finally say "scrap the whole thing and start all over." This is what we've done. What you've got here is a brand new push. I killed the old repository, deleted all other local copies, and started new. Stay tuned for more updates and an ever more complicated but higher functioning product. ~jt.
